Version 9.12.1
==============

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed in the
following sections. See the `migration guide
<https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/migration/9.12>`_ on the GHC Wiki
for specific guidance on migrating programs to this release.

Language
~~~~~~~~


- The ordering of variables used for visible type application has been changed in two cases.
  It is supposed to be left-to-right, but due to an oversight, it was wrong:

  - in an infix application ``f :: a `op` b``, it is now ``forall a op b.`` rather than
    ``forall op a b.``
  - in a linear type ``f :: a %m -> b``, it is now ``forall a m b.`` rather than
    ``forall a b m.``.

  This change is backwards-incompatible, although in practice we don't expect it
  to cause significant disruption.

Compiler
~~~~~~~~

- The flag `-fprof-late` will no longer prevent top level constructors from being statically allocated.

  It used to be the case that we would add a cost centre for bindings like `foo = Just bar`.
  This turned the binding into a caf that would allocate the constructor on first evaluation.

  However without the cost centre `foo` can be allocated at compile time. This reduces code-bloat and
  reduces overhead for short-running applications.

  The tradeoff is that calling `whoCreated` on top level value definitions like `foo` will be less informative.
